Track data usage using SNMP In/OutOctets

![go workflow](https://github.com/leonsteenkamp/data-bundle-tracker/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)

Built to track data usage and subtract it from a total loaded as a "data voucher".

Usage scenario would be tracking data usage from Mikrotik LTE dish using an SIM card
loaded with airtime.

Still lots of updates and tweaks needed, but the program is functional.

My first Go program! Built quickly, not beautifully.
